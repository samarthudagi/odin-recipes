    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>in any authentic butter chicken, the chicken is left to marinate in a mixture of yoghurt and spices for hours before cooking. The yoghurt makes the chicken super tender, while the spices penetrate it and give it much more depth of flavour. While the sauce isnâ€™t JUST made from butter, it is made up of a beautiful blend of rich ingredients: the yoghurt from the marinade, stock, tomato and cream.</p>
